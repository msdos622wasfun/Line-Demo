# Line-Demo
 A simple graphics demo.

This program was written in PureBasic.  It's a simple demo of a continuously growing and meandering line, which might not sound like much at first, but if you let it do its thing after a few moments things do start to get somewhat interesting.  Plus you have control over various parameters.
